### File Transfer Drill
***

In this drill we were tasked with making a program that could transfer files from one designated 
directory to another. My goal was to do this by creating objects in that performed each necessary step
of the process so that the code could be used later to perhaps perform a similar function or be incorporated
as events in a GUI.
