### GUI HTML maker with database
***

In this project I made a GUI that allowed a user to either create their own HTML file with a simple text message for customers or choose from a series of premade templates that are saved to a database. The user can also save their created html message as a tamplate to the database to be used later.

I used many features tkinter to create the GUI, then SQLite to create a database. This was great practice in GUI creation and manipulation.
