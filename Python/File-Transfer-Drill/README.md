### File Transfer Drill
***

These are a series of programs that can transfer the contents of a directory into another directory. The more advance programs involve a GUI where the user can select the directories to transfer the files to and from. 

This drill was completed with both python 2 using wxPython as a tool for the GUI and in python 3 using tkinter as a tool for the GUI. I first completed the task with wxPython and it was a good exercise transfering from python 2 to python 3 and using a different tool to complete a similar task.
