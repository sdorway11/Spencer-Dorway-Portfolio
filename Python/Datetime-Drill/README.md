### Datetime Drill
***

In this projcet I created a program that collected the current time in portland and then gave you the times in London and New York and tell you if the branch is open or closed.

Working on this I learned how to effectivly work with the datetime module as well as creating a program that could be added to if you wanted to add some other capabilities or city with new branches.
