### Wikipedia search program
***

I chose to try and employ a lot of my knowledge of python 3's capabilities by creating a program that scraped wikipedia for a topic that the user searches for. The main article then appears in the GUI where it can be saved to a database and called later.

This was an excellent exercise for me to practice working with many different features of python 3 together in a way that is organized, easy to read, and does everything I wanted it to. 

I also learned a valuble lesson after struggling with the webscrape aspect using BeautifulSoup4. I couldn't figure out why I was having a problem with it and it didn't seem to have any errors but it just wasn't working. It turned out to not be a problem with the code but for some reason Visual Studio just wasn't handeling the modual so I just had to write the program in IDLE.
