### A collection of creations by Spencer Dorway

I love learning new things and coding gives me the opportunity to my problem solving skills to create new things to solve all kinds of problems. On top of my coding training I recieved from The Tech Academy I have a background in linguistics with proficiant skills in Spanish and French. Learning coding is a lot like learning languages, it takes time to learn the rules and aquire the skills but once you do you can do anything. 

This repository contains my solutions to programming challenges that I have worked on and solved.
